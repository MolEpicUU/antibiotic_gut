FDA_new_data.do creates the datasets required for the functional data analysis. 
FDA_several_exposures.R carries out the functional data analysis for each cohort.
Confidence intervals for the analysis is generated by bootstrap. 
The bootstrap datasets are generated in FDA_meta_boot_new_data.do, 
and each bootstrap dataset is analyzed by functional data analysis in FDA_several_exposures_boot.R. 
Finally, meta-analysis of the three cohorts – both of the real dataset and of each bootstrap sample – 
is carried out in FDA_several_exposures_metaanalysis.do (which also creates the plots).
